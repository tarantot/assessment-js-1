const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step when requirements are being analyzed and tested about their completeness, correctness, consistency, unambiguity, testability, traceability, implementability, and prioritized by severity and importance due to the business logic."
const design = "The step when the system layout is being created to show how the final product is going to look like."
const implementation = "The process of the final product preparation due to the plan and requirements."
const testingAndIntegration = "The process of collecting information about the product quality with the following passing it on to stakeholders, and integration of it with already existing featurea and/or to marketplaces, production mode, etc."
const maintain = "The final process of SDLC which includes the sopport of product correct functioning and fixing due to users feedback."
